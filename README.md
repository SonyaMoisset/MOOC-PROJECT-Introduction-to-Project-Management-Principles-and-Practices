The first two courses in this Specialization include an orientation to client-side development, covering HTML/CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, and frameworks such as AngularJS and Bootstrap. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using the Ionic framework and Cordova. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to build a fully functional web and hybrid mobile application with back-end support.
